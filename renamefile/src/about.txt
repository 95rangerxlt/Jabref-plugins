Renamefile plugin.

This plugin helps to rename/copy/delete files attached
to the BibTex entries (stored in the field "file").

1. Name patterns
Files can be renamed according to their BibTeX entry.
The rename pattern uses the same syntax as the BibTeX
key generator of JabRef. Additionally you can use the
key [type] for an entry type. 

Some examples of name patterns:
[bibtexkey]
folder/subfolder/[auth]. [shorttitle]
[type]/[auth]-[year]-[title]
[authors]. [title]
[auth]-[year]-[shorttitle]
[auth:lower]_[veryshorttitle:lower]_[year]

2. Folders
One can move files relative to their current position: 
Uncheck "Use folder".

Or one can move files relative to the file directory:
Check "Use folder" and specify the relative folder.
Example: folder/subfolder or folder\subfolder.

Or one can move files using absolute paths:
Check "Use folder" and specify the absolute folder.
Example c:\folder\subfolder.

3. Several files in one entry
If there are several files attached to one entry, then
numbers are added at the end of file names.
